\begin_layout Title
Mixed contribution of Metastable Gravitino DM and Pulsars to the positron
 excess
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Metastable Gravitino Dark Matter 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know that in general is quite difficult to explain the positron fraction
 using only DM decays.
 In particular we have computed this explicitly for a metastable gravitino
 dark matter (MGDM) with bilinear RpV and everything indicates that trilinear
 RpV also will be the case.
 This because there are observations in other channels, such as gamma rays
 (our paper), antiprotons, anti-others, etc (see Grefe's thesis) that limit
 the parameters of MGDM to such values that the contribution into charged
 leptons is not enough to explain the positron fraction anomaly.
 For instance, it should be possible to ask about the maximal contribution
 of MGDM to the positron fraction which is consistent with multimessenger
 constraints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This situation appears to be true for almost every DM model that tries to
 explain the positron fraction with DM, although each model maybe/surely
 predicts different absolute contributions to the positron fraction.
 Having this is mind, another natural question that we need to address is
 about the part of the positron fraction that still needs to be explained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Pulsars
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems difficult that the full positron fraction can be explained by consideri
ng multiple DM candidates, since the problem of the constrained correlated
 channles is always there, instead it has been shown that pulsars may contribute
 to the positron fraction too.
 This source is astrophysical and in principle it seems a little bit obscure
 from a particle physics point of view.
 However, the modelling of the pulsar contribution is mostly given by transport
 equations, such as those to compute the propagation of charged leptons
 through the galaxy, that depend on some paramereters, such as the diffusion
 coefficient, and initial conditions for the fluxes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, it turns out that the contribution of pulsars is not clear yet and
 it is possible to find papers that go from a full explanation to the positron
 fraction (Hooper like) to those that estimate its constribution as negligible
 (HAWC like, where the derivation of pulsar contribution is derived from
 gamma ray observations).
 This allow us to argue that some part of the positron fraction could be
 explained by pulsars and if we are able to compute this contribution we
 could indeed discuss the mixed contribution of MGDM and Pulsars to the
 positron fraction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mixed Contribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Between the available possibilities to consider a mixed contribution to
 the positron fraction from MGDM and Pulsars, we could start by considering
 some extremal cases.
 Assuming that these cases are not necessarily special we should apply a
 systematic approach for the discussion of the results so that we would
 be able to discuss other possibilities in the same foot.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, given a 
\series bold
maximal contribution from MGDM
\series default
 one could estimate what are the conditions on the transport equations describin
g the pulsar modelling under which we can get a 
\series bold
full explanation of the positron fraction anomaly
\series default
.
 These conditions can be compared with expectations from pulsar modelling
 and some discussion must be added.
 If the results of this comparison indicate that the contribution of pulsars
 is consistent with expectations, then we would have a model that explain
 the positron fraction which would be an interesting result.
 If we are able to systematically find more possibilities, better.
 Besides, we must discuss if the pulsar models that we need to explain the
 positron fraction predict something observable in other channels, maybe
 related with electromagnetic radiation.
 If these predictions are consistent with current observations we could
 estimate the experimental conditions under which it is possible to confirm
 or reject the current compatibility.

\begin_layout Section
Big Picture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The kind of analysis mentioned above in general words exploits and study
 the complementarity between indirect searches of DM and the properties
 of Cosmic Rays, wich is indeed an interdisciplinary subject in the overlap
 between particle physics and astrophysics.
 Commonly this area is defined as multimessenger analysis and include all
 the plethora of signals detected from the cosmos in order to understand
 the origin of cosmic rays.
 In fact, there is a contemporary review where this area of research is
 discussed with many details.
 Personally, I find this approach quite interesting to study because is
 undoubtably that we need to have under control the backgroud of cosmic
 rays if we want to disentagle the proper explanation for DM.
 Also, it involves several experiments currently working and others to come,
 such as CTA, gravitational waves, cosmological neutrinos, etc.
