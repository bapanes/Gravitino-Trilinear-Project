\begin_layout Title
Beyond Standard Dark Matter Constraints, Analysis of Sources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, following Grefe's thesis for example, we can see that gravitino
 DM (GDM) is a perfectly sounding scenario.
 In the sense that it is easy to satisfy generic constrains such as a long
 life time or the non relativistic nature of DM (cold dark matter paradigm).
 Still we need to check that in the case of metastable GDM we do not spoil
 null observations of exotic cosmic rays, such as antideuteron.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, we would like to go further since there are some observations that
 could put in troubles the gravitino as a good DM candidates, for instance
 by considering the typical problems that affect the cold dm paradigm, including
 wimps.
 These problems normally are solved by exotic dm scenarios, such as SIMP
 DM or Superfluid DM, etc.
 Anyway, what is more interesting for us are the observational problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, there are probes such as the CMB that also could offer
 new constraints to the GDM scenario that seems quite interesting to study
 in general, for instance see (Probing the BSM physics with CMB precision
 cosmology: an application to supersymmetry 1801.05736.pdf).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivation for Multimessenger analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of multimessenger analysis we have at least two different
 questions that are interesting, seeminly independent but which relation
 itself represents a possible avenue to investigate.
 On the one hand multimessenger analysis at high energies is used in astrophysic
s to understand the mechanism of particle production in astrophysical sources
 (Murase, Winter, etc).
 Other option is to study the potential of multimessenger detectors to constrain
 the contribution of Dark Matter candidates.
 Therefore, it is quite clear that at the end we could always think about
 the partial contribution of these two sources.
 For instance, for a fixed model we always can analyze the different possibiliti
es to contribute to the spectrum of multimessenger particles, specially
 interesting is the question about the consistent scenarios, which at some
 point could be predictable.
 In the sense that given a particular allowed contribution of Dark Matter
 to the spectra of multimessenger in some sense implies a testable prediction
 for the sources that are left in order to explain the phenomena.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the particular case of a gravitino dark matter scenario with trilinear
 R-parity violation, which is well motivated as a reasonable scenario to
 explain current gravitational probes, we have that a non-negligible contributio
n to the electron positron excess is allowed in a consistent way with probes
 such as antideuteron, EGB, neutrinos, etc.
 Given this contribution we can estimate the expected population of pulsars
 that may be probed from another kind of observation, such as gamma rays,
 cosmic rays, gravitational ways, etc.
 Thus, in our paper we could just compute the maximum contribution of GDM
 to the positron fraction anomaly allowed by multimessenger observations
 in other channels, and from this we could estimate some astrophysical informati
on such as the amount of pulsars that would be necessary to explain the
 full data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we are going to need to probe the most sensible observable to restrict
 GDM+3L we will need to simulate and handle numerically the fluxes of gravitino
 decays in several final states, including different propagation models.
 This is work for Edson and Nicolas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Second DM candidate on top of gravitinos
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we cannot explain the electron positron fraction with gravitinos, since
 its contribution to other observables put a stop on the total flux which
 only covers a 30-60% of the required area under the ep-fraction curve,
 what other candidate we could think about to cover the rest or how is covered
 the rest.
 In particular, in terms of particle physics, unther which circunstances
 there is other Sugra candidate to fill-out the rest of DM.
 Axions-Axinos? KK gravitinos? Indeed, these other candidates could alleviate
 other DM constraints that in a gravitino model is quite difficult to satisfy.
 Constraints derived from small scale structural problems or primordial
 universe observations through the CMB.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Este candidato podría ser interesante de estudiar por un par de razones:
 por un lado no se me ocurre si esto es posible en el modelo SUSY que estamos
 usando (un segundo candidato a DM) y por lo tanto la respuesta sobre el
 nuevo candidato queda abierta a múltiples opciones.
 Probablemente no sean WIMPs, pero quizas otro candidato mas exótico, como
 SIMPs or axions, etc.
 Por otro lado, otro candidato a materia oscura podria ser util para discutir
 otros observables que no son explicados por gravitinos, tales como las
 anomalías observadas en la formación de estructuras locales.
 Este tema esta bien estudiado y por ejemplo yo tengo entendido que SIMPs
 pueden explicar estas anomalías, por ejemplo.
 Entonces podríamos preguntarnos acerca de la posibilidad de tener GDM+SIMP
 y hace explicar observables complementarios.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What about a DM candidate whose interactions depend on the density?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case we could use the observational fact that DM density should
 be smaller as the distance from the center increases, so some interactions
 could be switch off and potential decays could have time to happen.
 This mechanism would be contrary to the over-density option, which works
 under the assumption that local signals are increase because of the increase
 of local DM density.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Complementary Questions: DM and CR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Personally, when we think about DM we initially consider that all the observatio
nal evidence is given by gravitational proves (see Grefe list for instance).
 Afterwards, when a DM particle model is implemented there are only few
 important aspects that are required, such as the proper relic density (producti
on mechanism), the stability of the candidate (symmetries protecting its
 decays or annihilation), a correct kinetic behavior at the moment of matter-rad
iation equality (non-relativistic or axion-like) and the demand of collision-les
s.
 These requirements can be satisfied by several models, such as WIMPS, GDM,
 Axions, SIMPs, etc, so the posterior predictions cover a wide range of
 possibilities.
 From this point of view, we can see that the search of a DM candidates
 that satisfy these requirements is not sufficient to establish a sensible
 model with definite predictions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, beyond these requirements it is necessary to include more constraints.
 We suggest that this can be done considering the subject that study the
 origin of cosmic rays.
 For instance, in the context of the positron fraction anomaly, we cannot
 stop just by saying that GDM plus 3L is consistent with the signals for
 some values of the free parameters, but the GDM contribution undershoots
 the positron fraction anomaly.
 Thus, we should go further and try to understand other explanations about
 the rest of the positron fraction anomaly.
 For example, we could consider nearby pulsars.
 In this case we know that there is a tension between Hooper and Hawc inferences
 of the positron fraction, the former says that the positron fraction can
 be mostly explained by pulsars and the later says completely the contrary.
 To get a contribution in between we could consider which is the effect
 that make the difference between Hooper and Hawc and see if some interaction
 between leptons and DM could explain it.
 This interaction with leptons could be tested by direct detection experiments
 at Earth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, we propose that the quest of DM may be linked to the search
 of Cosmic Ray Sources in order to find models with more predictive power,
 at least more power than the current explanations of DM that basically
 have zero power.
