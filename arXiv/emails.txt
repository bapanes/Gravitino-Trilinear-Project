Dear Johannes Buchner,

I saw your paper arXiv:2011.09344 with great interest. For your information, I would like to notice that the parameter space of decaying gravitino motivated by the PAMELA/AMS-02 positron anomaly is severely constrained by the tomographic cross-correlation analysis between gamma-ray and local galaxy distribution:

I hope you find it helpful.

Best withes,
